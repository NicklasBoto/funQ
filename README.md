# funQ - Functional Quantum Programming

funQ is a functional domain specific programming language with affine types.
The syntax and type system is based on the theoretical quantum lambda calculus, [described here](https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0404056).

## Installation
You need to have [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/) installed. Some users may also have to install `blas` and `lapack`.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/NicklasBoto/funQ.git
$ cd funQ
$ stack install
```

Make sure you have the install location on your `PATH` (stack will tell you where this is).
